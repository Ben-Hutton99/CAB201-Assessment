# CAB201-Assessment

A command line online marketplace where users can bid on each others items. Users have to register their details and from there can access the programs functionalities.

This program has not been fully implemented as it lacks error checking, so an unexpected answer will cause an exception, and there are issues with selling items. Major blocks of code have been adequately commented with a summary and description of paramaters. Some of the code has been poorly written and the code overall could be more concise.
